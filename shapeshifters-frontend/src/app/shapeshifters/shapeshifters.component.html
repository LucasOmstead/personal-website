    <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
    <p>The game creates a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic where the hunted player must use wit and timing to outmaneuver their pursuer. The shape-shifting ability adds a layer of strategy, as players must choose the right moments to transform and blend in with the environment.</p>
    
    <p>This project was developed as part of the COMP-2800 Software Development course, where we learned to work as a team to design, implement, and test a complex interactive application. The project challenged us to integrate 3D graphics, game physics, and multiplayer networking into a cohesive gaming experience.</p>
