      <h2>About the Game</h2>
      <p>Shape Shifters is a 3D maze game that combines strategy, stealth, and quick reflexes. One player takes on the role of a hunter while the other becomes the runner. By using the game's Fog of War, moving walls, and their ability to morph into other players, the runner can escape the hunter and collect coins. This game was developed as part of a group project for COMP-2800 (Software Development). I implemented the shape-shifting logic, map/maze gen + moving walls, and movement logic.</p>
      <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
      <p>Shape Shifters uses Java3D to render the game environment. Networking is implemented in BasicServer.java which allows players to play on different machines connected to the internet. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/LucasOmstead/shapeshifters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</p>
