1. Add a leaderboard page to view the total score each player got; clickable to show match history
2. Make the model and yourself play the same number of rounds against all players to be fair (some randomness is necessary ofc)
3. Randomize the order in which you play each model
4. Make UI look better


For 1. 
All the state information should be stored in app.component. play-game should know how many rounds
to play before it actually plays. All other rounds should be calculated within app.component instead of result-table.
so that they can be displayed in a leaderboard.
